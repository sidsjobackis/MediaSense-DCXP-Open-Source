*** INTRODUCTION ***
In a near future the amount of sensors linked to electronical equipment will increase rapidly and thus also the need for distributing this new information to consuming applications and systems. In such an environment a centralized solutions is not applicable due to the massive amount of connecting nodes, which would bring any centralized server to its knees. This is where a real-time distributed system of context information with DCXP is a possible solutions - which we know from earlier research - performs better than other available solutions. [1][2][3]

The purpose of this project is to create a fully open-source solution without depending libraries. In addition the research-team’s current solutions are lacking certain core features or are not fully distributed and are thus inappropriate to use as bottom layer in a big scale system.
